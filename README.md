# Workshop
To get your addon here, just message one of the moderators/developers/contributors in the HL2:SB++ server with the appropriate thumbnail and addon link.

## Are addons supposed to be ZIP?
Yes.
In fact, they're should be like this:

```
> thing.zip
   > addon
       > scripts
       > ...
```

## Is this safe?
Yes.

## What are those addons in Releases?

Personal addons (by YourLocalMoon), just to reupload them.
